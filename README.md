Please add JUnit test cases to at least 5 previous practice problems you have created throughout the Java lessons. Attach a screenshot of each test case running successfully in your IDE along with the GitHub repo with your code. Each problem needs to be in the repo along with the correct package structure and test cases. You can add the screenshots and the GitHub links into a word file and submit that file.
